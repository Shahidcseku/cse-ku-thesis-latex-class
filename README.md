# CSEKU THESIS LATEX

This is a demo thesis format of CSE discipline, Khulna University developed by Md. Shahidul Islam. The class file 'csekuthesis.cls' is generated from the original class file 'report.cls' and contains all the formatting styles.

# How to use?

'chapters' directory contains all the chapters and pages. In order to put your own text and images use 'chapters' and 'images' directory respectively. Most probably you should not have to change the 'Thesis.tex' file; just compile it. In case of extra chapter or page, you can make changes to the 'Thesis.tex' file. Also, you need to include the packages on top of the file. 
You should put your references in 'References.bib' file.

# Caution
Please note that this is an unofficial formatting of the thesis book I guessed from my experience. I do not guarantee that this is the exact thesis format of CSEKU nor bear any responsibilities.
